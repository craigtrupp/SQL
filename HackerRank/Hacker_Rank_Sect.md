### **Challenges Defined** ü•á
* Challenges and individual SQL queries only added to subsequent file below after passing test cases on platform
* Well ... found something fairly let's say "odd" on the platform, the SQL version in the IDE is not always consistent and thus I just spent 20 minutes realizing my syntax wasn't wrong but the SQL version() was lower than 8 which doesn't support window functions
    - Long story, short .. use the below SQL query to check the VERSION is **`8+`** and can support Window Functions
```sql
-- Check Version
SELECT VERSION();

-- Output   
5.7.27-0ubuntu0.18.04.1 
```
* The platfrom test for the following sub-domains at an **Entry/Easy, Medium, and Hard** difficulty setting
    - Select üé±
    - Advanced Select üé± :heavy_plus_sign:
    - Aggregations üî¢
    - Basic Join ‚õìÔ∏è
    - Advanced Joins ‚õìÔ∏è ‚ûï
    - Alternative Queries :accept:

### **Files Locations** üìÅ
* #### **`Entry/Easy` SQL Difficulty Section**
    - Will highlight a few of these challenges following completion of the **`Difficulty - Easy`** section as all but 3 of the challenges for this Difficulty Setting are classified on the platform Under the Skill section as `SQL (Basic)`
        - **`Weather Observation Station 5`** - `SQL (Intermediate)` marked in this file [Weather Challenges - First Challenges](/HackerRank/diff_easy/weather_chall_easy.sql)
        - **`Draw the Triangle 1`** - `SQL (Advanced)`
        - **`Draw the Triangle 2`** - `SQL (Advanced)`
            * Both are in the same file at the end 
            * [Draw the Triangle Procedures/Recursive CTE](/HackerRank/diff_easy/final_section_challs.sql)
    - **[Weather Challenges - First Challenges](/HackerRank/diff_easy/weather_chall_easy.sql)**
    - **[Second Set](/HackerRank/diff_easy/second_set.sql)**
        * Good Question on Triangle Defining and **CASE/WHEN** from a CTE - See sql query for more details on questions
    - **[Third Set](/HackerRank/diff_easy/third_file_measy.sql)**
        * "The Blunder" and "Top Earners" were challenges worth more points
            * These two including CAST'ing, dervied (subqueries), and SQL method chaining for cleaning up errors
    - **[Fourth Final Set](/HackerRank/diff_easy/final_section_challs.sql)**
        * Basic Joins
        * Use of **FLOOR** for agg average of joined rows for countries and continent data
        * Procedures and Looping Syntax for final challenges

<br>

* #### **`Medium` SQL Difficulty Section**
    * [**`First Medium Set`**](/HackerRank/diff_medium/first_medium_set.sql)
        - **THE PADS** - Text Manipulation combined WITH Union'ing of aggregate values CONCATENATED to create single column output
        - **Occupation** - CASE/WHEN structure for row setting of all values in table by occupation followed by a Window function to rank the Name alphabetically for each occupation. Then to create a single table with multiple column output, we group by the window function result to pair the top ranking names alphabetically for each Occupation on the same row and use the COALESCE (which requires an agg function on a string - just a hack to get a return) to use the value for the row ranked occupation or null should one occupation have more results for names than another
