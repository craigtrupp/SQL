### **Introduction**
Balanced Tree Clothing Company prides themselves on providing an optimised range of clothing and lifestyle wear for the modern adventurer!

Danny, the CEO of this trendy fashion company has asked you to assist the teamâ€™s merchandising teams analyse their sales performance and generate a basic financial report to share with the wider business.

<br>

### **Available Data**
For this case study there is a total of 4 datasets for this case study - however you will only need to utilise 2 main tables to solve all of the regular questions, and the additional 2 tables are used only for the bonus challenge question!

<br>

`Product Details`
* `balanced_tree.product_details` includes all information about the entire range that Balanced Clothing sells in their store.

### **Case Study Questions**
The following questions can be considered key business questions and metrics that the Balanced Tree team requires for their monthly reports.

Each question can be answered using a single query - but as you are writing the SQL to solve each individual problem, keep in mind how you would generate all of these metrics in a single SQL script which the Balanced Tree team can run each month.

<br>

#### `A. High Level Sales Analysis`

**1.** What was the total quantity sold for all products?
```sql
SELECT
  s.prod_id AS prod_id, pd.product_name,
  SUM(s.qty) AS product_sales_counts
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS s 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd 
  ON s.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY prod_id, product_name
ORDER BY product_sales_counts DESC;
```
|prod_id|product_name|product_sales_counts|
|-----|-----|-----|
|9ec847|Grey Fashion Jacket - Womens|3876|
|c4a632|Navy Oversized Jeans - Womens|3856|
|2a2353|Blue Polo Shirt - Mens|3819|
|5d267b|White Tee Shirt - Mens|3800|
|f084eb|Navy Solid Socks - Mens|3792|
|e83aa3|Black Straight Jeans - Womens|3786|
|2feb6b|Pink Fluro Polkadot Socks - Mens|3770|
|72f5d4|Indigo Rain Jacket - Womens|3757|
|d5e9a6|Khaki Suit Jacket - Womens|3752|
|e31d39|Cream Relaxed Jeans - Womens|3707|
|b9a74d|White Striped Socks - Mens|3655|
|c8d436|Teal Button Up Shirt - Mens|3646|

<br>

**2.** What is the total generated revenue for all products before discounts?
* Recall that discount value is a **%** 
```sql
WITH product_counts AS (
SELECT
  s.prod_id AS prod_id, pd.product_name,
  SUM(s.qty) AS product_sales_counts
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS s 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd 
  ON s.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY prod_id, product_name
ORDER BY product_sales_counts 
)
SELECT 
  pc.prod_id, pc.product_name,
  ROUND(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price, 2) AS product_rev_pre_disc,
  CONCAT('$', ROUND(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price, 2)) as product_rev_pre_disc_str,
  -- Window SUM for the total product sales (as requested by the prompt) 
  CONCAT('$', SUM(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price) OVER()) AS total_product_rev_pre_disc
FROM product_counts AS pc 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_prices AS pp 
  ON pc.prod_id = pp.product_id
ORDER BY product_rev_pre_disc DESC;
```
|prod_id|product_name|product_rev_pre_disc|product_rev_pre_disc_str|total_product_rev_pre_disc|
|----|----|-----|-----|------|
|2a2353|Blue Polo Shirt - Mens|217683.00|$217683.00|$1289453|
|9ec847|Grey Fashion Jacket - Womens|209304.00|$209304.00|$1289453|
|5d267b|White Tee Shirt - Mens|152000.00|$152000.00|$1289453|
|f084eb|Navy Solid Socks - Mens|136512.00|$136512.00|$1289453|
|e83aa3|Black Straight Jeans - Womens|121152.00|$121152.00|$1289453|
|2feb6b|Pink Fluro Polkadot Socks - Mens|109330.00|$109330.00|$1289453|
|d5e9a6|Khaki Suit Jacket - Womens|86296.00|$86296.00|$1289453|
|72f5d4|Indigo Rain Jacket - Womens|71383.00|$71383.00|$1289453|

|c8d436|Teal Button Up Shirt - Mens|36460.00|$36460.00|$1289453|

* Now we can do a better just `CAST`'ing as a **Money** type 
```sql
WITH product_counts AS (
SELECT
  s.prod_id AS prod_id, pd.product_name,
  SUM(s.qty) AS product_sales_counts
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS s 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd 
  ON s.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY prod_id, product_name
ORDER BY product_sales_counts 
)
SELECT 
  pc.prod_id, pc.product_name,
  ROUND(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price, 2) AS product_rev_pre_disc,
  CAST(ROUND(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price, 2) AS money) as product_rev_pre_disc_str,
  -- Window SUM for the total product sales (as requested by the prompt )
  CAST(SUM(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price) OVER() AS money) AS total_product_rev_pre_disc
FROM product_counts AS pc 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_prices AS pp 
  ON pc.prod_id = pp.product_id
ORDER BY product_rev_pre_disc DESC;
```
|prod_id|product_name|product_rev_pre_disc|product_rev_pre_disc_str|total_product_rev_pre_disc|
|----|-----|-----|------|------|
|2a2353|Blue Polo Shirt - Mens|217683.00|$217,683.00|$1,289,453.00|

|c8d436|Teal Button Up Shirt - Mens|36460.00|$36,460.00|$1,289,453.00|

```sql
-- lol, this also works
SELECT
  -- Will multiply each row and simply take the sum of all rows quanity * price at the end
  SUM(qty * price) AS total_revenue,
  CAST(SUM(qty * price) AS money) AS str_total_revenue
FROM balanced_tree.sales;
```
|total_revenue|str_total_revenue|
|----|---|
|1289453|$1,289,453.00|

<br>

**3.** What was the total discount amount for all products?
* Let's look at a row first for the price post discount against w/o discount
```sql
SELECT 
  qty, price, discount,
  -- qty * (price - (price * (discount/100)))
  price - (price * (ROUND(discount::NUMERIC/100, 2))) AS indiviual_price_w_disc,
  -- explicit here about which operations to do first
  qty * (price - (price * (ROUND(discount::NUMERIC/100, 2)))) AS total_after_disc,
  qty * price AS total_pre_disc
FROM balanced_tree.sales
LIMIT 1;
```
|qty|price|discount|indiviual_price_w_disc|total_after_disc|total_pre_disc|
|---|----|----|-----|----|-----|
|4|13|17|10.79|43.16|52|

```sql
SELECT
  -- subtract base price by the discounted price of a product rounded to two decimals
  SUM(qty * ROUND(price - (price * discount/100::NUMERIC), 2)) AS total_amount_post_discount,
  CAST(SUM(qty * ROUND(price - (price * discount/100::NUMERIC), 2)) AS money) AS total_post_discount_$,
  -- and now we will simply take the total pre-discount and minus total-after discount for eact sale
  SUM(qty * price) - SUM(qty * ROUND(price - (price * discount/100::NUMERIC), 2)) AS total_discount_amount,
  CAST(SUM(qty * price) - SUM(qty * ROUND(price - (price * discount/100::NUMERIC), 2)) AS money) AS discount_amount_$
FROM balanced_tree.sales;
```
|total_amount_post_discount|total_post_discount_$|total_discount_amount|discount_amount_$|
|-----|-----|------|-----|
|1133223.86|$1,133,223.86|156229.14|$156,229.14|

<br><br>

### `B. Transaction Analysis`
**1.** How many unique transactions were there?
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) AS unique_transactions
FROM balanced_tree.sales;
```
|unique_transactions|
|-----|
|2500|

<br>

**2.** What is the average unique products purchased in each transaction?
* Let's look at two first here just to see how sales data looks per record in relation to an overall transaction
```sql
SELECT * FROM balanced_tree.sales WHERE txn_id IN ('54f307', '26cc98') LIMIT 10;
```
|prod_id|qty|price|discount|member|txn_id|start_txn_time|
|----|----|-----|----|----|----|----|
|c4a632|4|13|17|true|54f307|2021-02-13 01:59:43.296|
|5d267b|4|40|17|true|54f307|2021-02-13 01:59:43.296|
|b9a74d|4|17|17|true|54f307|2021-02-13 01:59:43.296|
|2feb6b|2|29|17|true|54f307|2021-02-13 01:59:43.296|
|c4a632|5|13|21|true|26cc98|2021-01-19 01:39:00.346|
|e31d39|2|10|21|true|26cc98|2021-01-19 01:39:00.346|
|72f5d4|3|19|21|true|26cc98|2021-01-19 01:39:00.346|
|2a2353|3|57|21|true|26cc98|2021-01-19 01:39:00.346|
|f084eb|3|36|21|true|26cc98|2021-01-19 01:39:00.346|

* So her we can see for two transaction ids over 9 rows is each product is given its own line in the sales table so we can look to group by the unique prod_id per `txn_id`

```sql
SELECT
  txn_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT prod_id) AS unique_prod_count_per_txn
FROM balanced_tree.sales
WHERE txn_id IN ('54f307', '26cc98')
GROUP BY txn_id
```
|txn_id|unique_prod_count_per_txn|
|----|----|
|26cc98|5|
|54f307|4|

```sql
WITH unique_prod_per_txn AS (
SELECT
  txn_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT prod_id) AS unique_prod_count_per_txn
FROM balanced_tree.sales
GROUP BY txn_id
)
SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(unique_prod_count_per_txn), 2) AS avg_unq_prod_per_txn
FROM unique_prod_per_txn;
```
|avg_unq_prod_per_txn|
|-----|
|6.04|

* If rounded to a **full** product would just be 6 here

<br>

**3.** What are the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values for the revenue per transaction?

* So just some first thoughts here. How is our pricing from sales against the product details.
* ... Also, this diverges a bit into percentile discussion and how to calculate in **sql** and **python**
```sql
-- Let's confirm that sales price and product_price is the same 
SELECT
  pd.product_id AS id, pd.product_name AS product,
  pd.price AS product_price, sal.price AS sale_price,
  COUNT(*) AS product_sale_prices_count
FROM balanced_tree.product_details AS pd 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.sales AS sal
  ON sal.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY id, product, product_price, sale_price;
```
|id|product|product_price|sale_price|product_sale_prices_count|
|---|----|----|-----|-----|
|f084eb|Navy Solid Socks - Mens|36|36|1281|
|e31d39|Cream Relaxed Jeans - Womens|10|10|1243|
|b9a74d|White Striped Socks - Mens|17|17|1243|
|5d267b|White Tee Shirt - Mens|40|40|1268|
|2a2353|Blue Polo Shirt - Mens|57|57|1268|
|9ec847|Grey Fashion Jacket - Womens|54|54|1275|
|e83aa3|Black Straight Jeans - Womens|32|32|1246|
|72f5d4|Indigo Rain Jacket - Womens|19|19|1250|
|c8d436|Teal Button Up Shirt - Mens|10|10|1242|
|d5e9a6|Khaki Suit Jacket - Womens|23|23|1247|
|c4a632|Navy Oversized Jeans - Womens|13|13|1274|
|2feb6b|Pink Fluro Polkadot Socks - Mens|29|29|1258|

* First observations is the product price and sale price is matched, a little uncertain how **profit** is measured but still getting familiar with the data set. Now since we're just looking for **revenue** we can get the total of each transaction prior to getting our `%` type figures for revenue

* Also, `percentile_disc` and `percentile_cont` are discussed in the provided solution and I wanted to better understand the difference
    - https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertutorial/9128/sql-server-statistical-window-functions-percentile-disc-and-percentile-cont/
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Gr93tPMXeo
    - Later in this video is helpful how the `percentile_disc` interprets the set of pulling a **percentile** from commonly aggregated values (think like a department average for salary). 
![sql_percentile_disc](images/percentilecont_percentiledisc_diff.png)
    - Here we can see how the Finance department return a median of 4100 for `percentile_disc` which details the even set of values  picking the **lower** band of an even set of values when looking for the median

* `Python` percentile for scores in a mocked test for reference on getting a percentile of a value in a set of ordered numbers
```python
# So here is a quick look at grabbing the percentile value that the person was in who scorred an 88 on the test 
>>> scores
[95, 93, 90, 89, 88, 87, 85, 83, 80, 78, 77, 76, 75, 70, 67]
>>> scores_sorted
[67, 70, 75, 76, 77, 78, 80, 83, 85, 87, 88, 89, 90, 93, 95]
>>> percentile_88_score = len(scores_sorted[:scores_])
KeyboardInterrupt
>>> values_below_88 = scores_sorted[:scores_sorted.index(88)]

**4.** What is the average discount value per transaction?
* We'll look at one row first here for how I take it. We would want to find the sum of all sales in a transaction prior to the discount and after to get a **total discount value** for the entire transaction which is a series of sales.
    - We can look at one order first **note** the shared : `txn_id` 

|prod_id|qty|price|discount|member|txn_id|start_txn_time|
|----|----|---|----|----|-----|----|
|c4a632|4|13|17|true|54f307|2021-02-13 01:59:43.296|
|5d267b|4|40|17|true|54f307|2021-02-13 01:59:43.296|
|b9a74d|4|17|17|true|54f307|2021-02-13 01:59:43.296|
|2feb6b|2|29|17|true|54f307|2021-02-13 01:59:43.296|

```sql
SELECT
  txn_id,
  -- Sum of Each sale in all sales for a transaction w a discount applied to the price and qty for each sale in an order 
  -- Recall discount applied as discount (which is integer) / 100 * price, then the price minus that to subtract discount amount from price before multiply by the quantity purchased 
  ROUND(SUM(qty * (price - ( price * (discount/100::NUMERIC) ) ) ), 2) AS txn_total_w_discount,
  -- Sum of Each sale in all sales for a transaction w/o a discount applied to the price and qty for each sale in an order
  SUM(qty * price) AS txn_total_wo_discount
FROM balanced_tree.sales
WHERE txn_id = '54f307'
GROUP BY txn_id
```
|txn_id|txn_total_w_discount|txn_total_wo_discount|
|----|----|----|
|54f307|280.54|338|

* As we can see here for the transaction that the sum total after applied the price discount is substantial!
    - Let's dig a bit deeper and use a `WINDOW FUNCTION` to look at an individual transaction sale discount applied at each level and validate the sum values from above on the entire total 

```sql
-- Just for fun can we do an example order for the discount applied at each sale in a transaction???
WITH individual_txn_sale_details AS (
SELECT
  prod_id, txn_id, qty, price, discount,
  ROUND (
  -- Remember you want to perform the window operation on each row prior to rounding the value returned from it 
    SUM(qty * (price - ( price * (discount/100::NUMERIC) ) ) )
      OVER (
        PARTITION BY prod_id, txn_id
    )
  , 2 ) AS sale_discount,
  ROUND (
    SUM(qty * price ) OVER (
      PARTITION BY prod_id, txn_id
    )
  , 2) AS sale_pre_discount
FROM balanced_tree.sales
WHERE txn_id = '54f307'
)
SELECT 
  *,
  SUM(sale_discount) OVER() AS txn_total_discount_sum,
  SUM(sale_pre_discount) OVER() AS txn_total_sum_no_discount
FROM individual_txn_sale_details
```
|prod_id|txn_id|qty|price|discount|sale_discount|sale_pre_discount|txn_total_discount_sum|txn_total_sum_no_discount|
|----|----|---|----|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|2feb6b|54f307|2|29|17|48.14|58.00|280.54|338.00|
|5d267b|54f307|4|40|17|132.80|160.00|280.54|338.00|
|b9a74d|54f307|4|17|17|56.44|68.00|280.54|338.00|
|c4a632|54f307|4|13|17|43.16|52.00|280.54|338.00|

- And ... back to the original question
```sql
-- Recall each SUM value in CTE below is performing the operation on each sale line before aggregating by the transaction
WITH txn_total AS (
SELECT

**5.** What is the percentage split of all transactions for members vs non-members?
```sql
-- What type is member (looks like a boolean but let's check)
SELECT
  table_catalog, table_schema, table_name, column_name, data_type
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE table_name = 'sales'
AND table_schema = 'balanced_tree';
```
|table_catalog|table_schema|table_name|column_name|data_type|
|----|-----|-----|-----|----|
|postgres|balanced_tree|sales|prod_id|character varying|
|postgres|balanced_tree|sales|qty|integer|
|postgres|balanced_tree|sales|price|integer|
|postgres|balanced_tree|sales|discount|integer|
|postgres|balanced_tree|sales|member|boolean|
|postgres|balanced_tree|sales|txn_id|character varying|
|postgres|balanced_tree|sales|start_txn_time|timestamp without time zone|

* We can see that the member check is a boolean here and not a str - varchar type

```sql
-- Quick validation that every transaction only has one distinct member value
SELECT
  txn_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT member) AS txn_member_unique_count
FROM balanced_tree.sales

-- No result greather than 1

-- Let's get a respone value here for future reference
SELECT
  array_agg(member) AS member_txn_values,
  -- can check cardinality but just also eyeball here that these are the same (length wise so each txn has same member boolean status)
  SUM(CASE WHEN member IS TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS member_sale_rows_per_txn,
  SUM(CASE WHEN member IS NOT TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS non_member_sale_rows_per_txn

* As we se here this is a sample transaction and how each sale within_txn provides a member status
    - The first query confirmed that no transaction has any more distinct member value (boolean check) greater than 1 meaning that all transactions when grouped by for each sale in the whole transaction only had 1 member value! Which is good and in theory duh ... but not always how it works

```sql

**6.** What is the average revenue for member transactions and non-member transactions?
```sql
-- This would've been easier for the last query lol
SELECT
  txn_id,
  -- get unique member value for each transaction
  array_agg(DISTINCT member) AS txn_member_flag
FROM balanced_tree.sales
GROUP BY txn_id
-- Let's see if a check here for ordering by the length of the aggregated distinct member for transaction is allowed
ORDER BY CARDINALITY(array_agg(DISTINCT member)) DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
|txn_id|txn_member_flag|
|-----|-----|
|000027|[ false ]|
|000106|[ true ]|
|000dd8|[ false ]|
|003920|[ true ]|
|003c6d|[ true ]|

* For future reference **CHECK** out the `ORDER BY` in the above query how we are using the length of unique distinct member values per transaction (**aka : value of the array_agg call**) to get one solitary value for if a transaction was a member or not!

```sql
WITH txn_distinct_mmb_status AS (
SELECT
  txn_id,
  -- get unique member value for each transaction
  array_agg(DISTINCT member) AS txn_member_flag
FROM balanced_tree.sales
GROUP BY txn_id
),
-- 
txn_total_join AS (
SELECT
  cte_txn_flg.txn_id AS id,
  cte_txn_flg.txn_member_flag[1] AS txn_flag,
  SUM(sales.qty * sales.price) AS txn_total
FROM txn_distinct_mmb_status AS cte_txn_flg
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.sales AS sales 
  ON cte_txn_flg.txn_id = sales.txn_id
GROUP BY id, txn_flag
)
SELECT 
  * 
FROM txn_total_join
LIMIT 5;
```
* With this CTE path we can now see how we have each unique transaction id and their total revenue pre_discount along with if the flag was a member or non member purchase

#### `Another Simpler Path`
* Above was fun because it's good to practice these techniques, however, here's a simpler path as well for reference
* First Step (Notice Output leads to similar agg value for the txn and member flag to yours??!)
```sql
  SELECT
    member,
    txn_id,
    SUM(price * qty) AS revenue
  FROM balanced_tree.sales
  GROUP BY member, txn_id
```
|member|txn_id|revenue|
|---|----|----|
|true|fc7210|224|
|false|a58b8a|488|
|true|bf755f|451|
|true|c2f82c|295|
|false|393360|250|

* Final Query
```sql
WITH cte_member_revenue AS (
  SELECT
    member,
    txn_id,
    SUM(price * qty) AS revenue
  FROM balanced_tree.sales
  GROUP BY member, txn_id
)
SELECT
  member,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY revenue) AS median_avg_rev,
  CAST(AVG(revenue) AS MONEY) AS mean_avg_rev
FROM cte_member_revenue
GROUP BY member;
```

|false|508|$515.04|
|true|511|$516.27|

### `C. Product Analysis`

**1.**  What are the top 3 products by total revenue before discount?
```sql
-- We'll take a peek at the first five
SELECT 
  pd.product_id, pd.product_name,
  SUM(sl.price * sl.qty) AS product_pre_disc_revenue,
  CAST(SUM(sl.price * sl.qty) AS MONEY) AS product_pre_disc_str

<br>

**2.** What is the total quantity, revenue and discount for each segment?
```sql
-- Let's peek at unique segments first to get an idea of what we're working with
SELECT 
  pd.product_id, pd.product_name, pd.price AS prod_price, pd.category_name, 
  sl.qty AS sale_qty, sl.price AS sale_price, sl.discount AS sale_discount_perc
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS sl 
  INNER JOIN 
  balanced_tree.product_details AS pd 
  ON sl.prod_id = pd.product_id
LIMIT 5;
```
|segment_id|segment_name|
|----|-----|
|4|Jacket|
|6|Socks|
|5|Shirt|
|3|Jeans|

* Look's pretty straight forward here for revenue pre & post discount as well as total counts

```sql
-- What is the total quantity, revenue and discount for each segment?
SELECT 
  pd.segment_id as seg_id, pd.segment_name AS seg_name,
  SUM(sl.qty) AS seg_total_qty,

  CAST(SUM(sl.price * sl.qty) AS MONEY) AS seg_no_disc_rev_str,
  -- Explicit state for order of operations for revenue segment sale after discount applied recall discount needs to be turned to a decimal
  ROUND (
    SUM(sl.qty * (sl.price - ((sl.discount/100::NUMERIC) * sl.price)))
  , 2) AS seg_rev_w_disc,
  CAST( 
  ROUND (
    SUM(sl.qty * (sl.price - ((sl.discount/100::NUMERIC) * sl.price)))
  , 2)

* This matches with the answer!
  - Good reminder here for how to get revenue with and without the discount applied (it's an integer we need to turn into a decimal)
  - Also about how to just see what the discount per segment is alone 

<br>

**3.** What is the top selling product for each segment?
```sql
-- What is the top selling product for each segment?
 SELECT 
  pd.product_id, pd.product_name, pd.segment_id, pd.segment_name,
  SUM(sl.qty) AS prod_seg_total
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS sl 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd
  ON sl.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY pd.product_id, pd.product_name, pd.segment_id, pd.segment_name
ORDER BY segment_name, prod_seg_total DESC;

* Here is a quick look pre ranking for the products ordered by their segment and the respective highest product from each segment in their grouped by and ordered by output above
  - Let's look to rank the segmented values with another column output than use the CTE structure to just select the top which we can validate from above

```sql
