### `3 - Foodie Fi` ü•ë
* Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!
* Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data. This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.
* While this is a smaller data schema and relational model, the presence of SCD (slowly changing dimensions) offers unique challenges to aggregate or finding leading/trailing data for our customer data
* This challenge also introduces **distribution** functions used to bin customers and their event history for clearer insights on customer behavior
* **Case Study Sections**
    - Customer Journey
        - Join Path for Data Access
    - Data Analysis Questions
        - Customer Plan Distribution
        - Time Distribution for Customers and Usage of different Subscription Levels
        - General Customer Subscription Upgrades and Downgrades Counts/Percentages
        - Customer Churn Data
    - Payment Table Creation - New Table w/following requirements
        - Montly payments always occur on the same day of the month as the original start_date
        - Upgrades from basic to monthly (or pror plans) are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
        - Upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
        - once a customer churn, they will no longer make payments

### `4 - Data Bank` üè¶
* This particular challenge mocks the management team at **Data Bank** looking to increase their total customer base by helping just how much data storage their customers would need
* **Sections covered in this challenge** focused on
    - Customer Metrics for Transaction and Node Usage
    - Descriptive Percentile and Statistic for Node Usage over different Partitions/Groups
    - Customer Transaction & Balance History over changing time dimensions
    - Threshold consideration for comparisons of balances in adjacent months
* Such approaches like `leading/lag window functions`, `generated series` for interval mocking, `conditional aggregate` functions for transaction determinstic values helped in the preparation of the customer & transaction data requested in the case study.
    - Window functions also included partitioned sections for customer balances and determining of activity against lagging balances

### `5 - Data Mart` üõí
* Within this challenge, our case study covers a theoretical sales performance for Danny's online supermarket.
* Key business questions center around the following topics
    - Quantifiable impact of changes introduced for a particular time period
    - **Platform, Region, Segment, & Customer Type** impact by mocked change and subsequent data over different periods
* Tasks also included `Data Cleansing` to generate a new table within the schema for easier data aggregation and metrics for the mentioned subsets above
    - Type Casting
    - Date Segmenting 
    - Finer Data Points and Clarifying Text Representation
    - Conditional Type setting from sql function returns on uncleansed data
* The **Data Exploration Section** looks to use the date values and is most resourceful through our ability to partition and generate summary statistics by partitioned values like **calendar_year** over different demographics
