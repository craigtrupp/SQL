# Fresh Segments (Extract Max Value!)
![Fresh Segment Cover](images/Fresh_Seg_Cover.png)

### **Introduction** üçä
Danny created `Fresh Segments`, a digital marketing agency that helps other businesses analyse trends in online ad click behaviour for their unique customer base.

Clients share their customer lists with the Fresh Segments team who then aggregate interest metrics and generate a single dataset worth of metrics for further analysis.

In particular - the composition and rankings for different interests are provided for each client showing the proportion of their customer list who interacted with online assets related to each interest for each month.

#### `Objective` üìî
Danny has asked for your assistance to analyse aggregated metrics for an example client and provide some high level insights about the customer list and their interests.


#### `Available Data / Tables` üóÑÔ∏è
For this case study there is a total of 2 datasets which you will need to use to solve the questions.

**Interest Metrics**
* This table contains information about aggregated interest metrics for a specific major client of Fresh Segments which makes up a large proportion of their customer base.
* Each record in this table represents the performance of a specific `interest_id` based on the client‚Äôs customer base interest measured through clicks and interactions with specific targeted advertising content.


|_month|_year|month_year|interest_id|composition|index_value|ranking|percentile_ranking|
|----|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|----|
|7	|2018	|07-2018	|32486	|11.89	|6.19	|1	|99.86|
|7	|2018	|07-2018	|6106	|9.93	|5.31	|2	|99.73|
|7	|2018	|07-2018	|18923	|10.85	|5.29	|3	|99.59|
|7	|2018	|07-2018	|6344	|10.32	|5.1	|4	|99.45|
|7	|2018	|07-2018	|100	|10.77	|5.04	|5	|99.31|
|7	|2018	|07-2018	|69	    |10.82	|5.03	|6	|99.18|
|7	|2018	|07-2018	|79	    |11.21	|4.97	|7	|99.04|
|7	|2018	|07-2018	|6111	|10.71	|4.83	|8	|98.9|
|7	|2018	|07-2018	|6214	|9.71	|4.83	|8	|98.9|
|7	|2018	|07-2018	|19422	|10.11	|4.81	|10	|98.63|

For example - let‚Äôs interpret the first row of the interest_metrics table together:
* In July 2018, the composition metric is 11.89, meaning that 11.89% of the client‚Äôs customer list interacted with the interest interest_id = 32486 - we can link interest_id to a separate mapping table to find the segment name called ‚ÄúVacation Rental Accommodation Researchers‚Äù

The index_value is 6.19, means that the composition value is 6.19x the average composition value for all Fresh Segments clients‚Äô customer for this particular interest in the month of July 2018.

The ranking and percentage_ranking relates to the order of index_value records in each month year.

**Interest Map**
* This mapping table links the interest_id with their relevant interest information. 
* You will need to join this table onto the previous interest_details table to obtain the interest_name as well as any details about the summary information.

## **Case Study Questions** :books:
The following questions can be considered key business questions that are required to be answered for the Fresh Segments team.

Most questions can be answered using a single query however some questions are more open ended and require additional thought and not just a coded solution!

<br>

### `A. Data Exploration and Cleansing` ü•æ :broom:
**1.** Update the **fresh_segments.interest_metrics** table by modifying the **month_year** column to be a date data type with the start of the month
```sql
-- Check Types
SELECT
  column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'interest_metrics' AND table_schema = 'fresh_segments';
```
|column_name|data_type|
|----|-----|
|_month|text|
|_year|text|
|month_year|text|
|interest_id|integer|
|composition|double precision|
|index_value|double precision|
|ranking|integer|
|percentile_ranking|double precision|

```sql
-- idea of the column mutation setting
SELECT
  TO_DATE(month_year, 'MM-YYYY'),
  month_year
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
LIMIT 5;

-- Update 
UPDATE fresh_segments.interest_metrics
SET month_year = TO_DATE(month_year, 'MM-YYYY');

-- DML Required to update Schema
ALTER TABLE fresh_segments.interest_metrics
ALTER month_year TYPE DATE USING month_year::DATE;

-- Similarly call the information schema at the beginning of the question to validate the output and column being updated
```
|column_name|data_type|
|-----|-----|
|_month|text|
|_year|text|
|month_year|date|
|interest_id|integer|
|composition|double precision|
|index_value|double precision|
|ranking|integer|
|percentile_ranking|double precision|


<br>

**2.** What is count of records in the fresh_segments.interest_metrics for each month_year value sorted in chronological order (earliest to latest) with the null values appearing first?
```sql
SELECT
  DATE_PART('Month', month_year) AS Month_Extract,
  month_year AS month_column,
  COUNT(*) AS monthly_record_count
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
GROUP BY Month_Extract, month_column
-- Can use or month_extract to group by months of different years
-- for comparisson which a normal desc on the month_column wouldn't allow
ORDER BY Month_Extract DESC;
```
|month_extract|month_column|monthly_record_count|
|-----|------|------|
|null|null|1194|
|12|2018-12-01|995|
|11|2018-11-01|928|
|10|2018-10-01|857|
|9|2018-09-01|780|
|8|2018-08-01|767|
|8|2019-08-01|1149|
|7|2019-07-01|864|
|7|2018-07-01|729|
|6|2019-06-01|824|
|5|2019-05-01|857|
|4|2019-04-01|1099|
|3|2019-03-01|1136|
|2|2019-02-01|1121|
|1|2019-01-01|973|

<br>

**3.** What do you think we should do with these null values in the fresh_segments.interest_metrics
* As our metrics look heavily involved in regards to time (see counts above), we can likely remove the null values from our data as there is not contextual or referential ways to impute the values.
* Looking at this in the context of the overall dataset and the business problem - it does not make too much sense to include these erroneous records into the analysis because we are going to be interested in the records only with a date specified!

**4.** How many interest_id values exist in the fresh_segments.interest_metrics table but not in the fresh_segments.interest_map table? What about the other way around?
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(interest_metrics.interest_id) AS all_interest_metric,
  COUNT(interest_map.id) AS all_interest_map,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN interest_map.id IS NULL THEN interest_metrics.interest_id ELSE NULL END) AS not_in_map,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN interest_metrics.interest_id IS NULL THEN interest_map.id ELSE NULL END)  AS not_in_metrics
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
FULL OUTER JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map
  ON interest_metrics.interest_id = interest_map.id;
```
|all_interest_metric|all_interest_map|not_in_map|not_in_metrics|
|----|----|----|----|
|1202|1209|0|7|

`Note`: We can also use an **anti-join** which is conceptually a little easier to understand here in terms of checking where there isn't any intersection on the shared id values 

```sql
-- Anti Join
SELECT 
(
  SELECT
    COUNT(id)
  FROM fresh_segments.interest_map AS i_map 
  WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT
      1
    FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics AS i_metrics 
    WHERE i_metrics.interest_id = i_map.id
  ) 
) AS interest_map_id_count_unique,
(
  SELECT
    COUNT(interest_id)
  FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics AS i_metrics
  WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT
      1
    FROM fresh_segments.interest_map AS i_map 
    WHERE i_map.id = i_metrics.interest_id
  ) 
) AS interest_metrics_id_count_unique
```
|interest_map_id_count_unique|interest_metrics_id_count_unique|
|----|----|
|7|0|

* What about the unique ID values though?
```sql
SELECT 
(
  SELECT
    ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT i_map.id)
  FROM fresh_segments.interest_map AS i_map 
  WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT
      1
    FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics AS i_metrics 
    WHERE i_metrics.interest_id = i_map.id
  ) 
) AS interest_map_id_count_unique,
(
  SELECT
    ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT i_metrics.interest_id)
  FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics AS i_metrics
  WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT
      1
    FROM fresh_segments.interest_map AS i_map 
    WHERE i_map.id = i_metrics.interest_id
  ) 
) AS interest_metrics_id_count_unique
```
|interest_map_id_count_unique|interest_metrics_id_count_unique|
|----|-----|
|[ 19598, 35964, 40185, 40186, 42010, 42400, 47789 ]|[ null ]|

<br>

**5.** Summarise the id values in the fresh_segments.interest_map by its total record count in this table
```sql
-- First part of query to look at all rows for each id 
SELECT
  id,
  COUNT(*) AS id_rows
FROM fresh_segments.interest_map
GROUP BY id 
ORDER BY id_rows DESC;
```
|id|id_rows|
|--|-----|
|10978|1|
|7546|1|
|51|1|
|45524|1|
|6062|1|

* On first impression it doesn't look like **interest_map** has any duplicate id values in the table
    - After grouping by the id and the rows found for each id, we can then pull another level of aggregation by grouping by the total_record aggregated value for each id to see how many ids share the same number of rows
    - Keep in mind that the `id_rows` didn't show any id greater than one particular row so would assume that the record_count should be the same for all ids
```sql
WITH interest_map_id_row_counts AS (
SELECT
  id,
  COUNT(*) AS id_rows
FROM fresh_segments.interest_map
GROUP BY id
),
record_counts AS (
SELECT
  -- group by the counts from previous query
  id_rows AS id_record_counts,
  COUNT(*) AS total_ids_w_shared_recourd_count
FROM interest_map_id_row_counts
GROUP BY id_record_counts
ORDER BY total_ids_w_shared_recourd_count DESC
)
SELECT * FROM record_counts;
```
|id_record_counts|total_ids_w_shared_recourd_count|
|---|----|
|1|1209|

<br>

**6.** What sort of table join should we perform for our analysis and why? Check your logic by checking the rows where interest_id = 21246 in your joined output and include all columns from fresh_segments.interest_metrics and all columns from fresh_segments.interest_map except from the id column.
```sql
WITH cte_join AS (
SELECT
  -- Can grab all columns with the .* usage for a join table output 
  interest_metrics.*,
  interest_map.interest_name,
  interest_map.interest_summary,
  interest_map.created_at,
  interest_map.last_modified
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
INNER JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map
  ON interest_metrics.interest_id = interest_map.id
WHERE interest_metrics.month_year IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT * FROM cte_join
WHERE interest_id = 21246;
```

Since we know all of the records from the `interest_details` table exists in the `interest_map` and there are no duplicate records on the `id` column in the `fresh_segments.interest_map` - we can use either LEFT JOIN or INNER JOIN for the analysis, however it depends on the order of the tables specified in the join.

If we use the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` as our base - we can use either join. However if we use the `fresh_segments.interest_map` table as the base, we must use INNER JOIN to remove all records in the metrics table which do not have a relevant interest_id value.
* Meaning there are some id values in the map which if performing a left join would be included that do not have any associative metric rows

Additionally - if you want to be as strict as possible - using an INNER JOIN is the best solution as you will also remove the missing `interest_id `values from the `fresh_segments.interest_metrics` table - but you will still need to deal with the single record which has a valid `interest_id` value.

<br>

**7.** Are there any records in your joined table where the month_year value is before the created_at value from the fresh_segments.interest_map table? Do you think these values are valid and why?
```sql
WITH cte_join AS (
SELECT
  -- Can grab all columns with the .* usage for a join table output 
  interest_metrics.*,
  interest_map.interest_name,
  interest_map.interest_summary,
  interest_map.created_at,
  interest_map.last_modified
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
INNER JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map
  ON interest_metrics.interest_id = interest_map.id
WHERE interest_metrics.month_year IS NOT NULL
),
month_year_before_created_at AS (
SELECT 
  *
FROM cte_join
WHERE month_year < created_at
ORDER BY interest_id
)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT interest_id) FROM month_year_before_created_at;
```
|count|
|---|
|188|

So there are definitely rows which show this characteristic - however, when we think about this from a deeper perspective - all of our metrics look like they are created monthly!

Having the beginning of the month may just be a proxy for a summary version of all of our aggregated metrics throughout the month - so in this case we need to be wary that the `month_year` column might well be before our created_at column - **but it shouldn‚Äôt be from an earlier month!!**

* Let‚Äôs confirm this by comparing the truncatated beginning of month for each created_at value with the month_year column again:

```sql
-- Quick view of operation output prior to 
WITH cte_join AS (
SELECT
  -- Can grab all columns with the .* usage for a join table output 
  interest_metrics.*,
  interest_map.interest_name,
  interest_map.interest_summary,
  interest_map.created_at,
  interest_map.last_modified
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
INNER JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map
  ON interest_metrics.interest_id = interest_map.id
WHERE interest_metrics.month_year IS NOT NULL
),
month_year_before_created_at AS (
SELECT 
  interest_id,
  month_year,
  created_at
FROM cte_join
WHERE month_year < created_at
ORDER BY interest_id
)
SELECT * FROM month_year_before_created_at LIMIT 5;
```
|interest_id|month_year|created_at|
|----|----|----|
|32701|2018-07-01|2018-07-06 14:35:03.000|
|32702|2018-07-01|2018-07-06 14:35:04.000|
|32703|2018-07-01|2018-07-06 14:35:04.000|
|32704|2018-07-01|2018-07-06 14:35:04.000|
|32705|2018-07-01|2018-07-06 14:35:04.000|

```sql
WITH cte_join AS (
SELECT
  -- Can grab all columns with the .* usage for a join table output 
  interest_metrics.*,
  interest_map.interest_name,
  interest_map.interest_summary,
  interest_map.created_at,
  interest_map.last_modified
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
INNER JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map
  ON interest_metrics.interest_id = interest_map.id
WHERE interest_metrics.month_year IS NOT NULL
),
month_year_before_created_at AS (
SELECT 
  interest_id,
  month_year,
  created_at
FROM cte_join
WHERE month_year < created_at
ORDER BY interest_id
)
SELECT 
  *,
  DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) AS created_at_month_trunc
FROM month_year_before_created_at LIMIT 5;
```
|interest_id|month_year|created_at|created_at_month_trunc|
|-----|----|----|----|
|32701|2018-07-01|2018-07-06 14:35:03.000|2018-07-01|
|32702|2018-07-01|2018-07-06 14:35:04.000|2018-07-01|
|32703|2018-07-01|2018-07-06 14:35:04.000|2018-07-01|
|32704|2018-07-01|2018-07-06 14:35:04.000|2018-07-01|
|32705|2018-07-01|2018-07-06 14:35:04.000|2018-07-01|

* We can now with the `date_trunc` return setting the `created_at` column to the beginning of the month (see fourth column above), check if the same condition **month_year < created_at_month_trunc** with the new output yields any rows

```sql
WITH cte_join AS (
SELECT
  -- Can grab all columns with the .* usage for a join table output 
  interest_metrics.*,
  interest_map.interest_name,
  interest_map.interest_summary,
  interest_map.created_at,
  interest_map.last_modified
FROM fresh_segments.interest_metrics
INNER JOIN fresh_segments.interest_map
  ON interest_metrics.interest_id = interest_map.id
WHERE interest_metrics.month_year IS NOT NULL
),
month_year_before_created_at AS (
SELECT 
  interest_id,
  month_year,
  created_at
FROM cte_join
WHERE month_year < created_at
ORDER BY interest_id
),
created_at_trunc AS (
SELECT 
  *,
  DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) AS created_at_month_trunc
FROM month_year_before_created_at
)
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) 
FROM created_at_trunc 
WHERE month_year < created_at_month_trunc
```
|count|
|---|
|0|

* After setting the `created_at` column to the months' beginning date, we see there is now predating value from the `interest_metrics` table before the id declaration in `interest_map`
    - We can see that there are no rows for this query - so all of our data points seem to be valid for our case study!
