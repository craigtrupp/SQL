## Foodie - Fi 

![Foodie Fi Intro](Images/Intro_img.png)

### Introduction
Subscription based businesses are super popular and Danny realised that there was a large gap in the market - he wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows!

Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!

Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data. This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.

### Table Details
#### `Table 1: plans`

Customers can choose which plans to join Foodie-Fi when they first sign up.

Basic plan customers have limited access and can only stream their videos and is only available monthly at $9.90

Pro plan customers have no watch time limits and are able to download videos for offline viewing. Pro plans start at $19.90 a month or $199 for an annual subscription.

Customers can sign up to an initial 7 day free trial will automatically continue with the pro monthly subscription plan unless they cancel, downgrade to basic or upgrade to an annual pro plan at any point during the trial.

When customers cancel their Foodie-Fi service - they will have a churn plan record with a null price but their plan will continue until the end of the billing period.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM foodie_fi.plans;
```
|plan_id|plan_name|price|
|----|----|----|
|0|trial|0.00|
|1|basic monthly|9.90|
|2|pro monthly|19.90|
|3|pro annual|199.00|
|4|churn|null|

<br>

#### `Table 2: subscriptions`
Customer subscriptions show the exact date where their specific plan_id starts.

If customers downgrade from a pro plan or cancel their subscription - the higher plan will remain in place until the period is over - the start_date in the subscriptions table will reflect the date that the actual plan changes.

When customers upgrade their account from a basic plan to a pro or annual pro plan - the higher plan will take effect straightaway.

When customers churn - they will keep their access until the end of their current billing period but the start_date will be technically the day they decided to cancel their service.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
LIMIT 5;
```
|customer_id|plan_id|start_date|
|-----|-----|-----|
|1|0|2020-08-01|
|1|1|2020-08-08|
|2|0|2020-09-20|
|2|3|2020-09-27|
|3|0|2020-01-13|

### Case Study Questions
This case study is split into an initial data understanding question before diving straight into data analysis questions before finishing with 1 single extension challenge.

`A. Customer Journey`

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

```sql
SELECT *
FROM foodie_fi.plans fp
INNER JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions sb
  USING(plan_id)
-- sample 8 customer_ids of interest (1,2,11,13,15,16,18,19)
WHERE sb.customer_id in (1,2,11,13,15,16,18,19)
ORDER BY customer_id, start_date;
```
|plan_id|plan_name|price|customer_id|start_date|
|----|-----|----|----|----|
|0|trial|0.00|1|2020-08-01|
|1|basic monthly|9.90|1|2020-08-08|
|0|trial|0.00|2|2020-09-20|
|3|pro annual|199.00|2|2020-09-27|
|0|trial|0.00|11|2020-11-19|
|4|churn|null|11|2020-11-26|
|0|trial|0.00|13|2020-12-15|
|1|basic monthly|9.90|13|2020-12-22|
|2|pro monthly|19.90|13|2021-03-29|
|0|trial|0.00|15|2020-03-17|
|2|pro monthly|19.90|15|2020-03-24|
|4|churn|null|15|2020-04-29|
|0|trial|0.00|16|2020-05-31|
|1|basic monthly|9.90|16|2020-06-07|
|3|pro annual|199.00|16|2020-10-21|
|0|trial|0.00|18|2020-07-06|
|2|pro monthly|19.90|18|2020-07-13|

|2|pro monthly|19.90|19|2020-06-29|
|3|pro annual|199.00|19|2020-08-29|

<br>

`B. Data Analysis Questions`

**1**. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
```sql
SELECT 
COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions;
```
|count|
|---|
|1000|

<br>

**2**. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
```sql
SELECT
  DATA_TYPE, column_name,is_nullable
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE table_name = 'subscriptions';
```
|data_type|column_name|is_nullable|
|----|-----|-----|
|integer|customer_id|YES|
|integer|plan_id|YES|
|date|start_date|YES|

* First item of note, when peeking into this request we want to ensure to either `CAST` or validate we can use a date function .. which we can!

```sql
-- Can aggregate on a particular truncated value from a date data_type, default is the beginning of the month
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('month', start_date) AS month,
  COUNT(*) AS trial_plan_subscribers
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 0
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```
|month|trial_plan_subscribers|
|----|----|
|2020-01-01|88|
|2020-02-01|68|
|2020-03-01|94|
|2020-04-01|81|
|2020-05-01|88|
|2020-06-01|79|
|2020-07-01|89|
|2020-08-01|88|
|2020-09-01|87|
|2020-10-01|79|
|2020-11-01|75|
|2020-12-01|84|

<br>

3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name
```sql
SELECT 
  sub.plan_id AS plan_id,
  pl.plan_name AS plan,
  COUNT(*) AS post_2020_plan_start_dates
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions sub 
INNER JOIN foodie_fi.plans pl 
  USING(plan_id)
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sub.start_date) > 2020
-- WHERE sub.start_date > '2020-12-31'
GROUP BY plan_id, plan 
ORDER BY plan_id;
```
|plan_id|plan|post_2020_plan_start_dates|
|----|-----|-----|
|1|basic monthly|8|
|2|pro monthly|60|
|3|pro annual|63|
|4|churn|71|

<br>


4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
```sql
WITH churn_total_subs AS (
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_unq_custs,
  -- Need a Subquery for conditional plan check for churn count
  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions WHERE plan_id = 4) AS total_unq_churn_custs
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
)
SELECT *, 
  ROUND(100 * (total_unq_churn_custs::NUMERIC/total_unq_custs), 1) AS churn_perc
FROM churn_total_subs;
```
|total_unq_custs|total_unq_churn_custs|churn_perc|
|-----|-----|-----|
|1000|307|30.7|

* Another flavor
```sql
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN plan_id = 4 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS churn_customers,
  ROUND(
    100 * SUM(CASE WHEN plan_id = 4 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) /
      COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)::NUMERIC
  , 1) AS percentage -- Recall floor division (cast one value as numeric)
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions;
```
|churn_customers|percentage|
|---|---|
|307|30.7|

* Out of curiousity ... have any customers churned ... then came back?? We could rank/partition by the customer and the date values we have to rank the customer_events by oldest to most recent
```sql
SELECT
  sb.customer_id,
  pl.plan_id,
  pl.plan_name,
  sb.start_date,
  RANK() OVER (
    PARTITION BY sb.customer_id
    ORDER BY sb.start_date
  ) AS customer_event_ranking
FROM foodie_fi.plans pl 
INNER JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions sb
  USING(plan_id)
ORDER BY sb.customer_id
LIMIT 20;
```
|customer_id|plan_id|plan_name|start_date|customer_event_ranking|
|-----|----|-----|-----|-----|
|1|0|trial|2020-08-01|1|
|1|1|basic monthly|2020-08-08|2|
|2|0|trial|2020-09-20|1|
|2|3|pro annual|2020-09-27|2|
|3|0|trial|2020-01-13|1|
|3|1|basic monthly|2020-01-20|2|
|4|0|trial|2020-01-17|1|
|4|1|basic monthly|2020-01-24|2|
|4|4|churn|2020-04-21|3|


<br>

* Confirms Count is equal to 307 (aggregating for customer)
```sql
WITH customer_event_rankings AS (
SELECT
  sb.customer_id,
  pl.plan_id,
  pl.plan_name,
  sb.start_date,
  RANK() OVER (
    PARTITION BY sb.customer_id
    ORDER BY sb.start_date
  ) AS customer_event_ranking
FROM foodie_fi.plans pl 
INNER JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions sb
  USING(plan_id)
ORDER BY sb.customer_id
),
plan_ranking_cust_agg AS (
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  array_agg(plan_id) AS plan_id_values,
  array_agg(customer_event_ranking) AS ranking_values
FROM customer_event_rankings
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id
)
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM plan_ranking_cust_agg
WHERE 4 = ANY(plan_id_values)
LIMIT 10
```
|customer_id|plan_id_values|ranking_values|
|-----|-----|------|
|4|[ 0, 1, 4 ]|[ "1", "2", "3" ]|
|6|[ 0, 1, 4 ]|[ "1", "2", "3" ]|
|11|[ 0, 4 ]|[ "1", "2" ]|
|15|[ 0, 2, 4 ]|[ "1", "2", "3" ]|
|21|[ 0, 1, 2, 4 ]|[ "1", "2", "3", "4" ]|
|33|[ 0, 2, 4 ]|[ "1", "2", "3" ]|
|39|[ 0, 1, 2, 4 ]|[ "1", "2", "3", "4" ]|
|48|[ 0, 1, 4 ]|[ "1", "2", "3" ]|
|51|[ 0, 1, 3, 4 ]|[ "1", "2", "3", "4" ]|
|52|[ 0, 1, 4 ]|[ "1", "2", "3" ]|

* Alright we can see here that `array_agg` has allowed us to group and consolidate the event_ranking and plan_id, we would now want to see if the last value in the plan_id wasn't a 4 which would represent the churn not being the last customer action

```sql
WITH customer_event_rankings AS (
SELECT
  sb.customer_id,
  pl.plan_id,
  pl.plan_name,
  sb.start_date,
  RANK() OVER (
    PARTITION BY sb.customer_id
    ORDER BY sb.start_date
  ) AS customer_event_ranking
FROM foodie_fi.plans pl 
INNER JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions sb
  USING(plan_id)
ORDER BY sb.customer_id
),
plan_ranking_cust_agg AS (
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  array_agg(plan_id) AS plan_id_values,
  array_agg(customer_event_ranking) AS ranking_values
FROM customer_event_rankings
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id
),
churned_customer_history AS (
SELECT 
  *,
  plan_id_values[array_upper(plan_id_values, 1)] AS last_ranked_plan -- pulls the last value from the plan_id_values
FROM plan_ranking_cust_agg
WHERE 4 = ANY(plan_id_values)
)
SELECT * FROM churned_customer_history LIMIT 5;
```
|customer_id|plan_id_values|ranking_values|last_ranked_plan|
|----|-----|-----|-----|
|4|[ 0, 1, 4 ]|[ "1", "2", "3" ]|4|
|6|[ 0, 1, 4 ]|[ "1", "2", "3" ]|4|
|11|[ 0, 4 ]|[ "1", "2" ]|4|
|15|[ 0, 2, 4 ]|[ "1", "2", "3" ]|4|
|21|[ 0, 1, 2, 4 ]|[ "1", "2", "3", "4" ]|4|

* After getting the churned customer history we can now do a simple `WHERE` check to see if any last_ranked_plan is not equal to 4 of the `churn` plan. Handy that the array_agg is maintaining the sequenced order of the `plan_id_values` and `customer_event_ranking`
```sql
WITH customer_event_rankings AS (
SELECT
  sb.customer_id,
  pl.plan_id,
  pl.plan_name,
  sb.start_date,
  RANK() OVER (
    PARTITION BY sb.customer_id
    ORDER BY sb.start_date
  ) AS customer_event_ranking
FROM foodie_fi.plans pl 
INNER JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions sb
  USING(plan_id)
ORDER BY sb.customer_id
),
plan_ranking_cust_agg AS (
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  array_agg(plan_id) AS plan_id_values,
  array_agg(customer_event_ranking) AS ranking_values
FROM customer_event_rankings
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id, ranking_values -- orderby requires the ranking values to be ordered by for correct array_agg by the looks (sequentially put the most recent plan as last for any customer)
),
churned_customer_history AS (
SELECT 
  *,
  plan_id_values[array_upper(plan_id_values, 1)] AS last_ranked_plan -- pulls the last value from the plan_id_values
FROM plan_ranking_cust_agg
WHERE 4 = ANY(plan_id_values)
)
SELECT
  last_ranked_plan,
  COUNT(*)
FROM churned_customer_history
GROUP BY last_ranked_plan;
```
|last_ranked_plan|count|
|----|----|
|4|307|

* Check the type of a column for a with CTE return
```sql
SELECT pg_typeof(last_ranked_plan), last_ranked_plan, customer_id FROM churned_customer_history;
```
|pg_typeof|last_ranked_plan|customer_id|
|----|-----|----|
|integer|4|4|
|integer|4|6|
|integer|4|11|

SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS total_direct_churns_from_trial,
  ROUND(100 * (COUNT(*)::NUMERIC / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions)), 1) AS direct_churn_percentage_all_customers,
  ROUND(100 * (COUNT(*)::NUMERIC / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM churned_customer_history)), 1) AS direct_churn_percentage_churn_customers

**8**. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?

This question is not difficult in terms of the SQL - but rather it is about understanding what the actual metric is.

You might be thinking about customers who upgraded and remained on an annual plan (that would be more difficult!) - or you might remove customers who churned perhaps? What if a customer upgrades and downgrades and upgrades again - do we count them twice?

All of these suggestions are not strictly correct as the question is not about what happens before or after an upgrade event!
```sql
SELECT
  plan_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 3 AND start_date <= '2020-12-31'
GROUP BY plan_id;

-- Another flavor (Same count for the plan)
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS annual_customers
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 3
  AND start_date BETWEEN '2020-12-31' AND '2020-01-01';
```
|plan_id|count|
|----|----|
|3|195|

<br>

**9.** How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?
```sql
-- How many days on average does it take for a customer to register as an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?
WITH annual_customer_history AS (
SELECT 
  *,
  RANK() OVER (
    PARTITION BY customer_id
    ORDER BY start_date
  ) AS customer_event_rank
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
WHERE customer_id in (
  -- Can isolate the customers who at some point have had an anuual plan w/subquery
  SELECT DISTINCT customer_id FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions WHERE plan_id = 3
) 
ORDER BY customer_id, start_date
),
start_annual_dates AS (
SELECT
  customer_id,
  array_agg(start_date ORDER BY customer_event_rank) AS initial_annual_dates
FROM annual_customer_history
WHERE customer_event_rank = 1 OR plan_id = 3 -- capture first event and date of annual plan 
GROUP BY customer_id
),
age_difference AS (
SELECT 
  *,
  initial_annual_dates[2]::date - initial_annual_dates[1]::date AS total_between_days
FROM start_annual_dates 
)
SELECT ROUND(AVG(total_between_days)) AS avg_days_initial_annual
FROM age_difference;
```
|avg_days_initial_annual|
|----|
|105|

<br>

**10.** Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)
```sql
-- How many days on average does it take for a customer to register as an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?

WHERE customer_event_rank = 1 OR plan_id = 3 -- capture first event and date of annual plan 
GROUP BY customer_id

### `C. Challenge Payment Question`
The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:

* monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
* upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
* upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
* once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

Example outputs for this table might look like the following:

|customer_id|plan_id|plan_name|payment_date|amount|payment_order|
|-----|-----|------|-----|-----|-----|
|1|1|basic monthly|2020-08-08|9.90|1|
|1|1|basic monthly|2020-09-08|9.90|2|
|1|1|basic monthly|2020-10-08|9.90|3|
|1|1|basic monthly|2020-11-08|9.90|4|
|1|1|basic monthly|2020-12-08|9.90|5|
|2|3|pro annual|2020-09-27|199.00|1|

* Here we use a `LEAD` to see if any non **churn** or **trial** plan would be a subsequent cutoff date and if it's not will pull forward the next subscription date for the customer. As the customer plan we find may be the last and return a **null** we can subsequently set any null value as the end of the year to indicate any row for the customer found as such would be their last subscription data for the year of interest
