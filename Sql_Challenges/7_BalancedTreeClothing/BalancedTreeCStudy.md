### **Case Study Questions** ‚ùì
The following questions can be considered key business questions and metrics that the Balanced Tree team requires for their monthly reports.

Each question can be answered using a single query - but as you are writing the SQL to solve each individual problem, keep in mind how you would generate all of these metrics in a single SQL script which the Balanced Tree team can run each month.

#### `Case Study : Categories` üìë

  <li>Bonus Challenge</li>
</ol>

<br>

#### `A. High Level Sales Analysis`

**1.** What was the total quantity sold for all products?
```sql
SELECT
  s.prod_id AS prod_id, pd.product_name,
  SUM(s.qty) AS product_sales_counts
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS s 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd 
  ON s.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY prod_id, product_name
ORDER BY product_sales_counts DESC;
```

|c8d436|Teal Button Up Shirt - Mens|3646|

<br>

**2.** What is the total generated revenue for all products before discounts?
* Recall that discount value is a **%** 
```sql
WITH product_counts AS (
SELECT
  s.prod_id AS prod_id, pd.product_name,
  SUM(s.qty) AS product_sales_counts
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS s 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd 
  ON s.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY prod_id, product_name
ORDER BY product_sales_counts 
)
SELECT 
  pc.prod_id, pc.product_name,
  ROUND(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price, 2) AS product_rev_pre_disc,
  CONCAT('$', ROUND(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price, 2)) as product_rev_pre_disc_str,
  -- Window SUM for the total product sales (as requested by the prompt) 
  CONCAT('$', SUM(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price) OVER()) AS total_product_rev_pre_disc
FROM product_counts AS pc 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_prices AS pp 
  ON pc.prod_id = pp.product_id

|c8d436|Teal Button Up Shirt - Mens|36460.00|$36460.00|$1289453|

* Now we can do a better just `CAST`'ing as a **Money** type 
```sql
WITH product_counts AS (
SELECT
  s.prod_id AS prod_id, pd.product_name,
  SUM(s.qty) AS product_sales_counts
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS s 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd 
  ON s.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY prod_id, product_name
ORDER BY product_sales_counts 
)
SELECT 
  pc.prod_id, pc.product_name,
  ROUND(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price, 2) AS product_rev_pre_disc,
  CAST(ROUND(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price, 2) AS money) as product_rev_pre_disc_str,
  -- Window SUM for the total product sales (as requested by the prompt )
  CAST(SUM(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price) OVER() AS money) AS total_product_rev_pre_disc
FROM product_counts AS pc 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_prices AS pp 
  ON pc.prod_id = pp.product_id
ORDER BY product_rev_pre_disc DESC;
```

|c8d436|Teal Button Up Shirt - Mens|36460.00|$36,460.00|$1,289,453.00|

```sql
-- lol, this also works
SELECT
  -- Will multiply each row and simply take the sum of all rows quanity * price at the end
  SUM(qty * price) AS total_revenue,
  CAST(SUM(qty * price) AS money) AS str_total_revenue
FROM balanced_tree.sales;
```
|total_revenue|str_total_revenue|
|----|---|
|1289453|$1,289,453.00|

<br>

**3.** What was the total discount amount for all products?
* Let's look at a row first for the price post discount against w/o discount
```sql
SELECT 
  qty, price, discount,
  -- qty * (price - (price * (discount/100)))
  price - (price * (ROUND(discount::NUMERIC/100, 2))) AS indiviual_price_w_disc,
  -- explicit here about which operations to do first
  qty * (price - (price * (ROUND(discount::NUMERIC/100, 2)))) AS total_after_disc,
  qty * price AS total_pre_disc
FROM balanced_tree.sales
LIMIT 1;
```
|qty|price|discount|indiviual_price_w_disc|total_after_disc|total_pre_disc|
|---|----|----|-----|----|-----|
|4|13|17|10.79|43.16|52|

```sql
SELECT
  -- subtract base price by the discounted price of a product rounded to two decimals
  SUM(qty * ROUND(price - (price * discount/100::NUMERIC), 2)) AS total_amount_post_discount,
  CAST(SUM(qty * ROUND(price - (price * discount/100::NUMERIC), 2)) AS money) AS total_post_discount_$,
  -- and now we will simply take the total pre-discount and minus total-after discount for eact sale
  SUM(qty * price) - SUM(qty * ROUND(price - (price * discount/100::NUMERIC), 2)) AS total_discount_amount,
  CAST(SUM(qty * price) - SUM(qty * ROUND(price - (price * discount/100::NUMERIC), 2)) AS money) AS discount_amount_$
FROM balanced_tree.sales;
```
|total_amount_post_discount|total_post_discount_$|total_discount_amount|discount_amount_$|
|-----|-----|------|-----|
|1133223.86|$1,133,223.86|156229.14|$156,229.14|

<br><br>

### `B. Transaction Analysis`
**1.** How many unique transactions were there?
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) AS unique_transactions
FROM balanced_tree.sales;
```
|unique_transactions|
|-----|
|2500|

<br>

**2.** What is the average unique products purchased in each transaction?
* Let's look at two first here just to see how sales data looks per record in relation to an overall transaction
```sql
SELECT * FROM balanced_tree.sales WHERE txn_id IN ('54f307', '26cc98') LIMIT 10;
```
|prod_id|qty|price|discount|member|txn_id|start_txn_time|
|----|----|-----|----|----|----|----|
|c4a632|4|13|17|true|54f307|2021-02-13 01:59:43.296|
|5d267b|4|40|17|true|54f307|2021-02-13 01:59:43.296|
|b9a74d|4|17|17|true|54f307|2021-02-13 01:59:43.296|
|2feb6b|2|29|17|true|54f307|2021-02-13 01:59:43.296|
|c4a632|5|13|21|true|26cc98|2021-01-19 01:39:00.346|
|e31d39|2|10|21|true|26cc98|2021-01-19 01:39:00.346|
|72f5d4|3|19|21|true|26cc98|2021-01-19 01:39:00.346|
|2a2353|3|57|21|true|26cc98|2021-01-19 01:39:00.346|
|f084eb|3|36|21|true|26cc98|2021-01-19 01:39:00.346|

* So her we can see for two transaction ids over 9 rows is each product is given its own line in the sales table so we can look to group by the unique prod_id per `txn_id`

```sql
SELECT
  txn_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT prod_id) AS unique_prod_count_per_txn
FROM balanced_tree.sales
WHERE txn_id IN ('54f307', '26cc98')
GROUP BY txn_id
```
|txn_id|unique_prod_count_per_txn|
|----|----|
|26cc98|5|
|54f307|4|

```sql
WITH unique_prod_per_txn AS (
SELECT
  txn_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT prod_id) AS unique_prod_count_per_txn
FROM balanced_tree.sales
GROUP BY txn_id
)
SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(unique_prod_count_per_txn), 2) AS avg_unq_prod_per_txn
FROM unique_prod_per_txn;
```
|avg_unq_prod_per_txn|
|-----|
|6.04|

* If rounded to a **full** product would just be 6 here

<br>

**3.** What are the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values for the revenue per transaction?

* So just some first thoughts here. How is our pricing from sales against the product details.
* ... Also, this diverges a bit into percentile discussion and how to calculate in **sql** and **python**
```sql
-- Let's confirm that sales price and product_price is the same 
SELECT
  pd.product_id AS id, pd.product_name AS product,
  pd.price AS product_price, sal.price AS sale_price,
  COUNT(*) AS product_sale_prices_count
FROM balanced_tree.product_details AS pd 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.sales AS sal
  ON sal.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY id, product, product_price, sale_price;
```
|id|product|product_price|sale_price|product_sale_prices_count|
|---|----|----|-----|-----|

|5d267b|White Tee Shirt - Mens|40|40|1268|
|2a2353|Blue Polo Shirt - Mens|57|57|1268|

* First observations is the product price and sale price is matched, a little uncertain how **profit** is measured but still getting familiar with the data set. Now since we're just looking for **revenue** we can get the total of each transaction prior to getting our `%` type figures for revenue

* Also, `percentile_disc` and `percentile_cont` are discussed in the provided solution and I wanted to better understand the difference
    - https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertutorial/9128/sql-server-statistical-window-functions-percentile-disc-and-percentile-cont/
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Gr93tPMXeo
    - Later in this video is helpful how the `percentile_disc` interprets the set of pulling a **percentile** from commonly aggregated values (think like a department average for salary). 
![sql_percentile_disc](images/percentilecont_percentiledisc_diff.png)
    - Here we can see how the Finance department return a median of 4100 for `percentile_disc` which details the even set of values  picking the **lower** band of an even set of values when looking for the median

* `Python` percentile for scores in a mocked test for reference on getting a percentile of a value in a set of ordered numbers
```python
# So here is a quick look at grabbing the percentile value that the person was in who scorred an 88 on the test 
>>> scores
[95, 93, 90, 89, 88, 87, 85, 83, 80, 78, 77, 76, 75, 70, 67]
>>> scores_sorted
[67, 70, 75, 76, 77, 78, 80, 83, 85, 87, 88, 89, 90, 93, 95]
>>> percentile_88_score = len(scores_sorted[:scores_])
KeyboardInterrupt
>>> values_below_88 = scores_sorted[:scores_sorted.index(88)]

**4.** What is the average discount value per transaction?
* We'll look at one row first here for how I take it. We would want to find the sum of all sales in a transaction prior to the discount and after to get a **total discount value** for the entire transaction which is a series of sales.
    - We can look at one order first **note** the shared : `txn_id` 

|prod_id|qty|price|discount|member|txn_id|start_txn_time|
|----|----|---|----|----|-----|----|
|c4a632|4|13|17|true|54f307|2021-02-13 01:59:43.296|
|5d267b|4|40|17|true|54f307|2021-02-13 01:59:43.296|
|b9a74d|4|17|17|true|54f307|2021-02-13 01:59:43.296|
|2feb6b|2|29|17|true|54f307|2021-02-13 01:59:43.296|

```sql
SELECT
  txn_id,
  -- Sum of Each sale in all sales for a transaction w a discount applied to the price and qty for each sale in an order 
  -- Recall discount applied as discount (which is integer) / 100 * price, then the price minus that to subtract discount amount from price before multiply by the quantity purchased 
  ROUND(SUM(qty * (price - ( price * (discount/100::NUMERIC) ) ) ), 2) AS txn_total_w_discount,
  -- Sum of Each sale in all sales for a transaction w/o a discount applied to the price and qty for each sale in an order
  SUM(qty * price) AS txn_total_wo_discount
FROM balanced_tree.sales
WHERE txn_id = '54f307'
GROUP BY txn_id
```
|txn_id|txn_total_w_discount|txn_total_wo_discount|
|----|----|----|
|54f307|280.54|338|

* As we can see here for the transaction that the sum total after applied the price discount is substantial!
    - Let's dig a bit deeper and use a `WINDOW FUNCTION` to look at an individual transaction sale discount applied at each level and validate the sum values from above on the entire total 

```sql
-- Just for fun can we do an example order for the discount applied at each sale in a transaction???
WITH individual_txn_sale_details AS (
SELECT
  prod_id, txn_id, qty, price, discount,
  ROUND (
  -- Remember you want to perform the window operation on each row prior to rounding the value returned from it 
    SUM(qty * (price - ( price * (discount/100::NUMERIC) ) ) )
      OVER (
        PARTITION BY prod_id, txn_id
    )
  , 2 ) AS sale_discount,
  ROUND (
    SUM(qty * price ) OVER (
      PARTITION BY prod_id, txn_id
    )
  , 2) AS sale_pre_discount
FROM balanced_tree.sales
WHERE txn_id = '54f307'
)

- And ... back to the original question
```sql
-- Recall each SUM value in CTE below is performing the operation on each sale line before aggregating by the transaction
WITH txn_total AS (
SELECT
  txn_id,
  -- Sum of Each sale in all sales for a transaction w a discount applied to the price and qty for each sale in an order 
  -- Recall discount applied as discount (which is integer) / 100 * price, then the price minus that to subtract discount amount from price before multiply by the quantity purchased 
  ROUND(SUM(qty * (price - ( price * (discount/100::NUMERIC) ) ) ), 2) AS txn_total_w_discount,
  -- Sum of Each sale in all sales for a transaction w/o a discount applied to the price and qty for each sale in an order

* Looking good for one transaction getting the difference, now to all of them
```sql
WITH txn_total AS (
SELECT
  txn_id,
  -- Sum of Each sale in all sales for a transaction w a discount applied to the price and qty for each sale in an order 
  -- Recall discount applied as discount (which is integer) / 100 * price, then the price minus that to subtract discount amount from price before multiply by the quantity purchased

**5.** What is the percentage split of all transactions for members vs non-members?
```sql
-- What type is member (looks like a boolean but let's check)
SELECT
  table_catalog, table_schema, table_name, column_name, data_type
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE table_name = 'sales'
AND table_schema = 'balanced_tree';
```
|table_catalog|table_schema|table_name|column_name|data_type|
|----|-----|-----|-----|----|
|postgres|balanced_tree|sales|prod_id|character varying|
|postgres|balanced_tree|sales|qty|integer|
|postgres|balanced_tree|sales|price|integer|
|postgres|balanced_tree|sales|discount|integer|
|postgres|balanced_tree|sales|member|boolean|
|postgres|balanced_tree|sales|txn_id|character varying|
|postgres|balanced_tree|sales|start_txn_time|timestamp without time zone|

* We can see that the member check is a boolean here and not a str - varchar type

```sql
-- Quick validation that every transaction only has one distinct member value
SELECT
  txn_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT member) AS txn_member_unique_count
FROM balanced_tree.sales

ORDER BY txn_member_unique_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
-- No result greather than 1

-- Let's get a respone value here for future reference
SELECT
  array_agg(member) AS member_txn_values,
  -- can check cardinality but just also eyeball here that these are the same (length wise so each txn has same member boolean status)
  SUM(CASE WHEN member IS TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS member_sale_rows_per_txn,
  SUM(CASE WHEN member IS NOT TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS non_member_sale_rows_per_txn
FROM balanced_tree.sales

|member_txn_values|member_sale_rows_per_txn|non_member_sale_rows_per_txn|
|-----|-----|-----|
|[ false, false, false, false, false, false, false ]|0|7|

* As we se here this is a sample transaction and how each sale within_txn provides a member status
    - The first query confirmed that no transaction has any more distinct member value (boolean check) greater than 1 meaning that all transactions when grouped by for each sale in the whole transaction only had 1 member value! Which is good and in theory duh ... but not always how it works

```sql

  SUM(CASE WHEN member IS NOT TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS non_member_sale_rows_per_txn

**6.** What is the average revenue for member transactions and non-member transactions?
```sql
-- This would've been easier for the last query lol
SELECT
  txn_id,
  -- get unique member value for each transaction
  array_agg(DISTINCT member) AS txn_member_flag
FROM balanced_tree.sales
GROUP BY txn_id
-- Let's see if a check here for ordering by the length of the aggregated distinct member for transaction is allowed
ORDER BY CARDINALITY(array_agg(DISTINCT member)) DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
|txn_id|txn_member_flag|
|-----|-----|
|000027|[ false ]|
|000106|[ true ]|
|000dd8|[ false ]|
|003920|[ true ]|
|003c6d|[ true ]|

* For future reference **CHECK** out the `ORDER BY` in the above query how we are using the length of unique distinct member values per transaction (**aka : value of the array_agg call**) to get one solitary value for if a transaction was a member or not!

```sql
WITH txn_distinct_mmb_status AS (
SELECT
  txn_id,
  -- get unique member value for each transaction
  array_agg(DISTINCT member) AS txn_member_flag
FROM balanced_tree.sales
GROUP BY txn_id
),
-- 
txn_total_join AS (
SELECT
  cte_txn_flg.txn_id AS id,
  cte_txn_flg.txn_member_flag[1] AS txn_flag,
  SUM(sales.qty * sales.price) AS txn_total
FROM txn_distinct_mmb_status AS cte_txn_flg
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.sales AS sales 
  ON cte_txn_flg.txn_id = sales.txn_id
GROUP BY id, txn_flag
)
SELECT 
  * 
FROM txn_total_join
LIMIT 5;
```
* With this CTE path we can now see how we have each unique transaction id and their total revenue pre_discount along with if the flag was a member or non member purchase

#### `Another Simpler Path`
* Above was fun because it's good to practice these techniques, however, here's a simpler path as well for reference
* First Step (Notice Output leads to similar agg value for the txn and member flag to yours??!)
```sql
  SELECT
    member,
    txn_id,
    SUM(price * qty) AS revenue
  FROM balanced_tree.sales
  GROUP BY member, txn_id
```
|member|txn_id|revenue|
|---|----|----|
|true|fc7210|224|
|false|a58b8a|488|
|true|bf755f|451|
|true|c2f82c|295|
|false|393360|250|

* Final Query
```sql
WITH cte_member_revenue AS (
  SELECT
    member,
    txn_id,
    SUM(price * qty) AS revenue
  FROM balanced_tree.sales
  GROUP BY member, txn_id
)
SELECT
  member,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY revenue) AS median_avg_rev,
  CAST(AVG(revenue) AS MONEY) AS mean_avg_rev
FROM cte_member_revenue
GROUP BY member;
```

### `C. Product Analysis`

**1.**  What are the top 3 products by total revenue before discount?
```sql
-- We'll take a peek at the first five
SELECT 
  pd.product_id, pd.product_name,
  SUM(sl.price * sl.qty) AS product_pre_disc_revenue,

<br>

**2.** What is the total quantity, revenue and discount for each segment?
```sql
-- Let's peek at unique segments first to get an idea of what we're working with
SELECT 
  pd.product_id, pd.product_name, pd.price AS prod_price, pd.category_name, 
  sl.qty AS sale_qty, sl.price AS sale_price, sl.discount AS sale_discount_perc
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS sl 
  INNER JOIN 
  balanced_tree.product_details AS pd 
  ON sl.prod_id = pd.product_id
LIMIT 5;
```
|segment_id|segment_name|
|----|-----|
|4|Jacket|
|6|Socks|
|5|Shirt|
|3|Jeans|

* Look's pretty straight forward here for revenue pre & post discount as well as total counts

```sql
-- What is the total quantity, revenue and discount for each segment?
SELECT 
  pd.segment_id as seg_id, pd.segment_name AS seg_name,
  SUM(sl.qty) AS seg_total_qty, 
  SUM(sl.price * sl.qty) AS seg_no_disc_rev,
  CAST(SUM(sl.price * sl.qty) AS MONEY) AS seg_no_disc_rev_str,
  -- Explicit state for order of operations for revenue segment sale after discount applied recall discount needs to be turned to a decimal
  ROUND (
    SUM(sl.qty * (sl.price - ((sl.discount/100::NUMERIC) * sl.price)))
  , 2) AS seg_rev_w_disc,
  CAST( 
  ROUND (
    SUM(sl.qty * (sl.price - ((sl.discount/100::NUMERIC) * sl.price)))

* This matches with the answer!
  - Good reminder here for how to get revenue with and without the discount applied (it's an integer we need to turn into a decimal)
  - Also about how to just see what the discount per segment is alone 

<br>

**3.** What is the top selling product for each segment?
```sql
-- What is the top selling product for each segment?
 SELECT 
  pd.product_id, pd.product_name, pd.segment_id, pd.segment_name,
  SUM(sl.qty) AS prod_seg_total
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS sl 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd
  ON sl.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY pd.product_id, pd.product_name, pd.segment_id, pd.segment_name
ORDER BY segment_name, prod_seg_total DESC;
```
* Output of 12 rows matches the total from the product details total row count which we want

* Here is a quick look pre ranking for the products ordered by their segment and the respective highest product from each segment in their grouped by and ordered by output above
  - Let's look to rank the segmented values with another column output than use the CTE structure to just select the top which we can validate from above

```sql

**9.** What is the total transaction ‚Äúpenetration‚Äù for each product? (hint: penetration = number of transactions where at least 1 quantity of a product was purchased divided by total number of transactions
* So ... in a simpler way you simply want to aggregate each unique product in a single transaction and get the counts of how often a product occurs in any transaction, see below!

```sql
-- So for understanding, the below looks at how a product details are spread over one txn_id
-- We can look at one transaction to get the total unique products in a txn 
SELECT
  pd.product_id, pd.product_name, sl.txn_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT pd.product_id) AS product_sale_txns, -- would eliminate any duplicate products in one txn (not that it looks like it occurs but could!)
  SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER() AS total_sales_in_txn
FROM balanced_tree.product_details AS pd 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.sales AS sl 
  ON pd.product_id = sl.prod_id
WHERE sl.txn_id = '000027'
GROUP BY product_id, product_name, sl.txn_id
ORDER BY product_sale_txns DESC;
```
|product_id|product_name|txn_id|product_sale_txns|total_sales_in_txn|

* Now we can aggregate the `COUNT()` of all products found in each transaction and simply divide against the unique txn_ids

```sql
WITH unique_prod_per_txns AS (
SELECT
  pd.product_id, pd.product_name, sl.txn_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT pd.product_id) AS product_sale_txns -- would eliminate any duplicate products in one txn

INNER JOIN balanced_tree.sales AS sl 
  ON pd.product_id = sl.prod_id
GROUP BY product_id, product_name, sl.txn_id
)
SELECT
  product_id, 
  product_name,
  COUNT(*) AS product_txns,
  -- Subquery for unique transaction count against the count of all products total txn count
  CONCAT(ROUND(100 * (COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) FROM balanced_tree.sales)::NUMERIC), 2), '%') AS penetration_percentage,
  (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) FROM balanced_tree.sales) AS unique_transactions

* `Note` : Will be using a Recursive CTE here so let's remind ourselves how and what they do!
  - https://builtin.com/data-science/recursive-sql
  - A recursive SQL common table expression (CTE) is a query that continuously references a previous result until it returns an empty result. It‚Äôs best used as a convenient way to extract information from hierarchical data. It‚Äôs achieved using a CTE, which in SQL is known as a ‚Äúwith‚Äù statement. This allows you to name the result and reference it within other queries later. 
  - https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-tutorial/postgresql-recursive-query/   

```sql
-- Basic Recursive CTE
WITH RECURSIVE cte_count AS (
-- Anchor (Seed)
SELECT 1 n
UNION ALL
-- recursive member
SELECT n + 1
FROM cte_count 
WHERE n < 10 -- termination check
)
-- Invocation
SELECT n
FROM cte_count;

```
|n|
|--|
|1|
|2|
|3|
|4|
|5|
|6|
|7|
|8|
|9|
|10|

* Another good example of a recursive CTE is a factorial
```sql
--factorial
-- 1! = 1
-- 2! = 2 * 1

* Back to the Case Study
  - So, in our case we need to find the number of combinations of any 3 products (k=3) out of 12 unique products (n=12). Therefore, there are 220 possible combinations of products!
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE input(product) AS (
  SELECT product_id::TEXT FROM balanced_tree.product_details
),
output_table AS (
   SELECT 
    ARRAY[product] AS combo,
    product,
    1 AS product_counter
   FROM input
  
   UNION ALL  -- important to remove duplicates!

   SELECT
    ARRAY_APPEND(output_table.combo, input.product),
    input.product,
    product_counter + 1
   FROM output_table
   INNER JOIN input ON input.product > output_table.product
   WHERE output_table.product_counter <= 2
   )
SELECT * from output_table
WHERE product_counter = 3;
```
* The Combo generated array product yields 220 rows which is the unique count for all the number of our product combinations of 3 uniques products

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS temp_product_combos;
CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_product_combos AS
WITH RECURSIVE input(product) AS (
  SELECT product_id::TEXT FROM balanced_tree.product_details

   )

  FROM cte_combo_transactions
  INNER JOIN cte_ranked_combos
    ON cte_combo_transactions.combo = cte_ranked_combos.combo
  WHERE cte_ranked_combos.combo_rank = 1
)
-- step 6
SELECT

* Ok ... did a little digging and found something that makes a lot more sense for this question!
  - Important note on the Joins here : https://learnsql.com/blog/sql-non-equi-joins-examples/
  - The "<" symbol used in the non-equi join is for a elimination of duplicate pairs
  - Note that the products join below is on itself to combine the 222 type of unique product combination for our 12 products 3 times (so in short the sales/product join is just joined on itself twice to get the 3 unique product combinations)
```sql
SET
  SEARCH_PATH = balanced_tree;
SELECT
  product_1,
  product_2,
  product_3,
  times_bought_together
FROM
  (
    with products AS (
      SELECT
        txn_id,
        product_name
      FROM
        sales AS s
        JOIN product_details AS pd ON s.prod_id = pd.product_id
    )
    SELECT
      p.product_name AS product_1,
      p1.product_name AS product_2,
      p2.product_name AS product_3,
      COUNT(*) AS times_bought_together,
      ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
        ORDER BY
          COUNT(*) DESC
      ) AS rank
    FROM
      products AS p -- first CTE within subquery for product and sales join
      JOIN products AS p1 ON p.txn_id = p1.txn_id
        AND p.product_name != p1.product_name
        AND p.product_name < p1.product_name -- Eliminating duplicate pairs (non-equi-join)
      JOIN products AS p2 ON p.txn_id = p2.txn_id
        AND p.product_name != p2.product_name
        AND p1.product_name != p2.product_name
        AND p.product_name < p2.product_name
        AND p1.product_name < p2.product_name
    GROUP BY
      p.product_name,
      p1.product_name,

### `D. Bonus Challenge`
* Use a single SQL query to transform the product_hierarchy and product_prices datasets to the product_details table.
  - Recall : [Product Hierarchy & Price](#product-hierarcy--product-price-üìÅ) 
    - This earlier section in the Data Definition Intro Section of this File wanted us to focus on the Style items (hierarchy id 7-18) ... this is ultimately what will recreate the product details table as we have 12 products!
  - Product Details Outlook (Table we're recreating) : [Product Details](#product-details-üìÅ)

<br>

```sql
-- first join
SELECT 
  h.id, h.parent_id, h.level_text, h.level_name,
  t1.id AS lj_id, t1.parent_id AS lj_pid, t1.level_text AS lj_ltext, t1.level_name AS lj_lname
FROM balanced_tree.product_hierarchy AS h 
LEFT JOIN balanced_tree.product_hierarchy AS t1 
  ON h.parent_id = t1.id
```
|id|parent_id|level_text|level_name|lj_id|lj_pid|lj_ltext|lj_lname|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|----|

* Ok we can see the base tables and left join tables from each respective column in the self join
  - `Observations`
    * The first two rows have null values for the left join columns as there is no parent_id to match on for the primary id
    * Now once to the Jeans Level Text we see the item id of 3 and base parent id matched with itself (it is a self join) and the value of 1. With that we pull the values from the first row for the matching parent_id of 1 on the 3rd and 4th row of the output (hence the Womens Category)
    * Similar for men, the 5th and 6th row has a parent_id value of 2 which matches the men's Category
      - For these first **6** rows we see how the left join is duplicating values in our left join columns as the base id from this table is starting to match the parent_id in our left table
    * So the pattern here is looking at the parent_id value of our base_table which has 6 unique values (and a null) and how that value is duplicated so we can get the the types of products and the text for the build


<br>

* Now that we can see what one join did, we need to get the category now for our products

```sql
WITH hierarchy_to_product AS (
SELECT
  ph.id AS base_id,
  ph.level_text AS base_text,
  ph_lj1.id AS segment_id,
  ph_lj1.parent_id AS category_id,
  ph_lj1.level_text AS segment_text,
  ph_lj2.level_text AS category_text
FROM balanced_tree.product_hierarchy AS ph 
LEFT JOIN balanced_tree.product_hierarchy AS ph_lj1
  ON ph.parent_id = ph_lj1.id
LEFT JOIN balanced_tree.product_hierarchy AS ph_lj2
  ON ph_lj1.parent_id = ph_lj2.id 
  -- annoying we can't use the alias but we're matching our category_id from the first left (category_id) 
  -- just to the base_id of itself which is 1 or 2 and getting the text
)
SELECT * FROM hierarchy_to_product;
```
* Here is what the deconstructured `product_hierarchy` table now looks like!

|base_id|base_text|segment_id|category_id|segment_text|category_text|

|1|Womens|null|null|null|null|
