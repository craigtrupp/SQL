### **Case Study Questions**
The following questions can be considered key business questions and metrics that the Balanced Tree team requires for their monthly reports.

Each question can be answered using a single query - but as you are writing the SQL to solve each individual problem, keep in mind how you would generate all of these metrics in a single SQL script which the Balanced Tree team can run each month.
