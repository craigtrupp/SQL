Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.

Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.

The first Union Statement and subsequent group by statement is our way of weeding out simple pairs in a self-join
And getting unique pairs which from a self-join we'd want that (So think we are grouping from a unioned self-join in which we've just swapped 
    the position of the X,y coordinates so we can group by column)

-- Output to start (so now we have all the unique symmetric pairs and their counts from a self-join - we need to now merge the pairs into a single row and get the lowest X from the pairs)
