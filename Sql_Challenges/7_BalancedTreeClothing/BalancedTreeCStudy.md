### **Case Study Questions**
The following questions can be considered key business questions and metrics that the Balanced Tree team requires for their monthly reports.

Each question can be answered using a single query - but as you are writing the SQL to solve each individual problem, keep in mind how you would generate all of these metrics in a single SQL script which the Balanced Tree team can run each month.

<br>

#### `A. High Level Sales Analysis`

**1.** What was the total quantity sold for all products?
```sql
SELECT
  s.prod_id AS prod_id, pd.product_name,
  SUM(s.qty) AS product_sales_counts
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS s 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd 
  ON s.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY prod_id, product_name
ORDER BY product_sales_counts DESC;
```
|prod_id|product_name|product_sales_counts|
|-----|-----|-----|
|9ec847|Grey Fashion Jacket - Womens|3876|
|c4a632|Navy Oversized Jeans - Womens|3856|

|e31d39|Cream Relaxed Jeans - Womens|3707|
|b9a74d|White Striped Socks - Mens|3655|
|c8d436|Teal Button Up Shirt - Mens|3646|

<br>

**2.** What is the total generated revenue for all products before discounts?
* Recall that discount value is a **%** 
```sql
WITH product_counts AS (
SELECT
  s.prod_id AS prod_id, pd.product_name,
  SUM(s.qty) AS product_sales_counts
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS s 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd 
  ON s.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY prod_id, product_name
ORDER BY product_sales_counts 
)
SELECT 
  pc.prod_id, pc.product_name,
  ROUND(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price, 2) AS product_rev_pre_disc,
  CONCAT('$', ROUND(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price, 2)) as product_rev_pre_disc_str,
  -- Window SUM for the total product sales (as requested by the prompt) 
  CONCAT('$', SUM(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price) OVER()) AS total_product_rev_pre_disc
FROM product_counts AS pc 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_prices AS pp 
  ON pc.prod_id = pp.product_id
ORDER BY product_rev_pre_disc DESC;
```
|prod_id|product_name|product_rev_pre_disc|product_rev_pre_disc_str|total_product_rev_pre_disc|
|----|----|-----|-----|------|
|2a2353|Blue Polo Shirt - Mens|217683.00|$217683.00|$1289453|
|9ec847|Grey Fashion Jacket - Womens|209304.00|$209304.00|$1289453|

|c8d436|Teal Button Up Shirt - Mens|36460.00|$36460.00|$1289453|

* Now we can do a better just `CAST`'ing as a **Money** type 
```sql
WITH product_counts AS (
SELECT
  s.prod_id AS prod_id, pd.product_name,
  SUM(s.qty) AS product_sales_counts
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS s 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd 
  ON s.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY prod_id, product_name
ORDER BY product_sales_counts 
)
SELECT 
  pc.prod_id, pc.product_name,
  ROUND(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price, 2) AS product_rev_pre_disc,
  CAST(ROUND(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price, 2) AS money) as product_rev_pre_disc_str,
  -- Window SUM for the total product sales (as requested by the prompt )
  CAST(SUM(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price) OVER() AS money) AS total_product_rev_pre_disc
FROM product_counts AS pc 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_prices AS pp 
  ON pc.prod_id = pp.product_id
ORDER BY product_rev_pre_disc DESC;
```
|prod_id|product_name|product_rev_pre_disc|product_rev_pre_disc_str|total_product_rev_pre_disc|
|----|-----|-----|------|------|
|2a2353|Blue Polo Shirt - Mens|217683.00|$217,683.00|$1,289,453.00|
|9ec847|Grey Fashion Jacket - Womens|209304.00|$209,304.00|$1,289,453.00|

|e31d39|Cream Relaxed Jeans - Womens|37070.00|$37,070.00|$1,289,453.00|
|c8d436|Teal Button Up Shirt - Mens|36460.00|$36,460.00|$1,289,453.00|

```sql
-- lol, this also works
SELECT
  -- Will multiply each row and simply take the sum of all rows quanity * price at the end
  SUM(qty * price) AS total_revenue,
  CAST(SUM(qty * price) AS money) AS str_total_revenue
FROM balanced_tree.sales;
```
|total_revenue|str_total_revenue|
|----|---|
|1289453|$1,289,453.00|

<br>

**3.** What was the total discount amount for all products?
* Let's look at a row first for the price post discount against w/o discount
```sql
SELECT 
  qty, price, discount,
  -- qty * (price - (price * (discount/100)))
  price - (price * (ROUND(discount::NUMERIC/100, 2))) AS indiviual_price_w_disc,
  -- explicit here about which operations to do first
  qty * (price - (price * (ROUND(discount::NUMERIC/100, 2)))) AS total_after_disc,
  qty * price AS total_pre_disc
FROM balanced_tree.sales
LIMIT 1;
```
|qty|price|discount|indiviual_price_w_disc|total_after_disc|total_pre_disc|
|---|----|----|-----|----|-----|
|4|13|17|10.79|43.16|52|

```sql
SELECT
  -- subtract base price by the discounted price of a product rounded to two decimals
  SUM(qty * ROUND(price - (price * discount/100::NUMERIC), 2)) AS total_amount_post_discount,
  CAST(SUM(qty * ROUND(price - (price * discount/100::NUMERIC), 2)) AS money) AS total_post_discount_$,
  -- and now we will simply take the total pre-discount and minus total-after discount for eact sale
  SUM(qty * price) - SUM(qty * ROUND(price - (price * discount/100::NUMERIC), 2)) AS total_discount_amount,
  CAST(SUM(qty * price) - SUM(qty * ROUND(price - (price * discount/100::NUMERIC), 2)) AS money) AS discount_amount_$
FROM balanced_tree.sales;
```
|total_amount_post_discount|total_post_discount_$|total_discount_amount|discount_amount_$|
|-----|-----|------|-----|
|1133223.86|$1,133,223.86|156229.14|$156,229.14|

<br><br>

#### `B. Transaction Analysis`
**1.** How many unique transactions were there?
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT txn_id) AS unique_transactions
FROM balanced_tree.sales;
```
|unique_transactions|
|-----|
|2500|

<br>

**2.** What is the average unique products purchased in each transaction?
* Let's look at two first here just to see how sales data looks per record in relation to an overall transaction
```sql
SELECT * FROM balanced_tree.sales WHERE txn_id IN ('54f307', '26cc98') LIMIT 10;
```
|prod_id|qty|price|discount|member|txn_id|start_txn_time|
|----|----|-----|----|----|----|----|
|c4a632|4|13|17|true|54f307|2021-02-13 01:59:43.296|
|5d267b|4|40|17|true|54f307|2021-02-13 01:59:43.296|
|b9a74d|4|17|17|true|54f307|2021-02-13 01:59:43.296|
|2feb6b|2|29|17|true|54f307|2021-02-13 01:59:43.296|
|c4a632|5|13|21|true|26cc98|2021-01-19 01:39:00.346|
|e31d39|2|10|21|true|26cc98|2021-01-19 01:39:00.346|
|72f5d4|3|19|21|true|26cc98|2021-01-19 01:39:00.346|
|2a2353|3|57|21|true|26cc98|2021-01-19 01:39:00.346|
|f084eb|3|36|21|true|26cc98|2021-01-19 01:39:00.346|

* So her we can see for two transaction ids over 9 rows is each product is given its own line in the sales table so we can look to group by the unique prod_id per `txn_id`

```sql
SELECT
  txn_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT prod_id) AS unique_prod_count_per_txn
FROM balanced_tree.sales
WHERE txn_id IN ('54f307', '26cc98')
GROUP BY txn_id
```
|txn_id|unique_prod_count_per_txn|
|----|----|
|26cc98|5|
|54f307|4|

```sql
WITH unique_prod_per_txn AS (
SELECT
  txn_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT prod_id) AS unique_prod_count_per_txn
FROM balanced_tree.sales

GROUP BY txn_id
)
SELECT 
  ROUND(AVG(unique_prod_count_per_txn), 2) AS avg_unq_prod_per_txn
FROM unique_prod_per_txn;
```
|avg_unq_prod_per_txn|
|-----|
|6.04|

* If rounded to a **full** product would just be 6 here

**3.** What are the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values for the revenue per transaction?

**4.** What is the average discount value per transaction?

**5.** What is the percentage split of all transactions for members vs non-members?

**6.** What is the average revenue for member transactions and non-member transactions?
