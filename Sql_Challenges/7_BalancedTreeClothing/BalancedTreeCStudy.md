### **Case Study Questions**
The following questions can be considered key business questions and metrics that the Balanced Tree team requires for their monthly reports.

Each question can be answered using a single query - but as you are writing the SQL to solve each individual problem, keep in mind how you would generate all of these metrics in a single SQL script which the Balanced Tree team can run each month.

<br>

#### `A. High Level Sales Analysis`

**1.** What was the total quantity sold for all products?
```sql
SELECT
  s.prod_id AS prod_id, pd.product_name,
  SUM(s.qty) AS product_sales_counts
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS s 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd 
  ON s.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY prod_id, product_name
ORDER BY product_sales_counts DESC;
```
|prod_id|product_name|product_sales_counts|
|-----|-----|-----|
|9ec847|Grey Fashion Jacket - Womens|3876|
|c4a632|Navy Oversized Jeans - Womens|3856|

|b9a74d|White Striped Socks - Mens|3655|
|c8d436|Teal Button Up Shirt - Mens|3646|


**2.** What is the total generated revenue for all products before discounts?
* Recall that discount value is a **%** 
```sql
WITH product_counts AS (
SELECT
  s.prod_id AS prod_id, pd.product_name,
  SUM(s.qty) AS product_sales_counts
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS s 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd 
  ON s.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY prod_id, product_name
ORDER BY product_sales_counts 
)
SELECT 
  pc.prod_id, pc.product_name,
  ROUND(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price, 2) AS product_rev_pre_disc,
  CONCAT('$', ROUND(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price, 2)) as product_rev_pre_disc_str,
  -- Window SUM for the total product sales (as requested by the prompt) 
  CONCAT('$', SUM(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price) OVER()) AS total_product_rev_pre_disc
FROM product_counts AS pc 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_prices AS pp 
  ON pc.prod_id = pp.product_id
ORDER BY product_rev_pre_disc DESC;
```
|prod_id|product_name|product_rev_pre_disc|product_rev_pre_disc_str|total_product_rev_pre_disc|
|----|----|-----|-----|------|

|c8d436|Teal Button Up Shirt - Mens|36460.00|$36460.00|$1289453|

* Now we can do a better just `CAST`'ing as a **Money** type 
```sql
WITH product_counts AS (
SELECT
  s.prod_id AS prod_id, pd.product_name,
  SUM(s.qty) AS product_sales_counts
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS s 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd 
  ON s.prod_id = pd.product_id
GROUP BY prod_id, product_name
ORDER BY product_sales_counts 
)
SELECT 
  pc.prod_id, pc.product_name,
  ROUND(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price, 2) AS product_rev_pre_disc,
  CAST(ROUND(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price, 2) AS money) as product_rev_pre_disc_str,
  -- Window SUM for the total product sales (as requested by the prompt )
  CAST(SUM(pc.product_sales_counts * pp.price) OVER() AS money) AS total_product_rev_pre_disc
FROM product_counts AS pc 
INNER JOIN balanced_tree.product_prices AS pp 
  ON pc.prod_id = pp.product_id
ORDER BY product_rev_pre_disc DESC;
```
|prod_id|product_name|product_rev_pre_disc|product_rev_pre_disc_str|total_product_rev_pre_disc|
