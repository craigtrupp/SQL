### **Challenges Defined** ü•á
* Challenges and individual SQL queries only added to subsequent file below after passing test cases on platform
* Well ... found something fairly let's say "odd" on the platform, the SQL version in the IDE is not always consistent and thus I just spent 20 minutes realizing my syntax wasn't wrong but the SQL version() was lower than 8 which doesn't support window functions
    - Long story, short .. use the below SQL query to check the VERSION is **`8+`** and can support Window Functions
```sql
-- Check Version
SELECT VERSION();

-- Output   
5.7.27-0ubuntu0.18.04.1 
```
* The platfrom test for the following sub-domains at an **Entry/Easy, Medium, and Hard** difficulty setting
